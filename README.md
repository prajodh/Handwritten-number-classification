# Handwritten-number-classififction
Using the handwritten images to classify the number it represents.Along with the generic machine learning workflow, one huge concept that I learned and implemented in the project was the use of a learning rate scheduler to improve and find the best possible learning rate for the dataset to help it converge faster. After figuring out the optimized learning rate, I was able to increase the model's accuracy from 80 to 85 percent, but the overall experiment proved how much better the convoluted layers learn from images as the CNN had an accuracy of 88 percent.
